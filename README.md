This website is a mockup and is not intended for commercial use rather as a learning tool and to complete a 
project. 

Currently this is one of my top designed websites and I am proud of the work I have done on it.

This website took me about 1 week to complete.

As for the last part of the website stay tuned for the javascript as this part only requred HTML and CSS.
