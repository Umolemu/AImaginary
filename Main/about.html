This website is a mockup and is not intended for commercial use rather as a learning tool and to complete a 
project.

Currently this is one of my top designed websites and I am proud of the work I have done on it

This website took me about 1 week to complete

As for the last part of the website stay tuned for the javascript as this part only requred HTML and CSS
